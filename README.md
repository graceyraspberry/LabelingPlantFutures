## Objective

This research-backed tool is designed to help "plant-based" food manufacturing entrepreneurs make labeing decisions when bringing new products to market. Made for UGBA 198T Plant Futures Spring 2021. By Meredith Cunningham, Rebecca McGauley, and Grace Lam.

## Additional Considerations

While many of the variables included in the tool provide helpful guidance when making labeling decisions, there are several unseen factors that will influence the final decision. Outlined below are the top 3 additional factors to consider:

Brand Beliefs – What does the brand stand for? Is it stellar taste? Sustainability/ climate impact? Animal welfare? Nutrition? The belief of the brand is the unique differentiator that plays a major role in labeling, so boxing this in would limit the uniqueness of the brand.

Key Stakeholders – Consider all of the players that could influence your labeling choices. It is not just legal requirements that define the choices, but the investors, retailer buyers and consumers have major sway.

Risk Tolerance – The disruptive nature of the plant-based movement requires bravery & willingness to shake up established industries. The product label can challenge the status quo or carefully fly under the radar.
